**SalesDB - Tableau Sales Analysis -** <br />
üìä A Tableau project for analyzing sales data using various table calculations, aggregations, and visualizations.

**üìå Project Overview-**<br />
This project explores sales data using Tableau, leveraging different table calculations, ranking functions, and advanced aggregation techniques. It includes a detailed dashboard visualizing customer sales trends, cumulative totals, and comparisons.

**üìä Key Features-**<br />
1Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Name and Total Sales
Displays total sales for each customer.
Uses INDEX() to assign sequential numbers.
Uses RANK() to rank customers by total sales.<br />
2Ô∏è‚É£ Running Total Calculation
Down Rows: Calculates a running total row-by-row for each customer.
Across Columns: Calculates running totals horizontally across categories.
Used for trend analysis and cumulative contributions.<br />
3Ô∏è‚É£ Directional vs Non-Directional Table Calculations
Directional: Computes values based on data order (e.g., previous rows, next rows).
Non-directional: Computes values independent of the order (e.g., total functions).<br />
4Ô∏è‚É£ Aggregation Functions
Total Function: Computes total sales.
Window-Sum Function: Aggregates sales over a defined window.
Max Sales per Region: Identifies top-performing regions.
Average Sales per Product Category: Calculates category-wise performance.<br />
5Ô∏è‚É£ Incremental Complexity
Last Two Days of Sales: Tracks recent sales performance.
Cumulative Percentage of Sales: Analyzes contribution over time.<br />
6Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard Visualization
Combines all key metrics in an interactive dashboard.
Displays percentage of total sales, max sales, previous customers‚Äô total sales, and cumulative sales percentages.
