**SalesDB - Tableau Sales Analysis -**
📊 A Tableau project for analyzing sales data using various table calculations, aggregations, and visualizations.

**📌 Project Overview-**
This project explores sales data using Tableau, leveraging different table calculations, ranking functions, and advanced aggregation techniques. It includes a detailed dashboard visualizing customer sales trends, cumulative totals, and comparisons.

**📊 Key Features-**
1️⃣ Customer Name and Total Sales
Displays total sales for each customer.
Uses INDEX() to assign sequential numbers.
Uses RANK() to rank customers by total sales.
2️⃣ Running Total Calculation
Down Rows: Calculates a running total row-by-row for each customer.
Across Columns: Calculates running totals horizontally across categories.
Used for trend analysis and cumulative contributions.
3️⃣ Directional vs Non-Directional Table Calculations
Directional: Computes values based on data order (e.g., previous rows, next rows).
Non-directional: Computes values independent of the order (e.g., total functions).
4️⃣ Aggregation Functions
Total Function: Computes total sales.
Window-Sum Function: Aggregates sales over a defined window.
Max Sales per Region: Identifies top-performing regions.
Average Sales per Product Category: Calculates category-wise performance.
5️⃣ Incremental Complexity
Last Two Days of Sales: Tracks recent sales performance.
Cumulative Percentage of Sales: Analyzes contribution over time.
6️⃣ Dashboard Visualization
Combines all key metrics in an interactive dashboard.
Displays percentage of total sales, max sales, previous customers’ total sales, and cumulative sales percentages.
